# Building-a-Real-Time-Object-Detection-System-Using-YOLOv3-and-OpenCV
The script provides a full implementation of real-time object detection using YOLOv3 and OpenCV. It efficiently handles video frames, processes them through the YOLO network, and draws the detection results on the screen. The class-based structure makes it modular and easier to extend or modify for different applications.
